# OBS-Timestamper

**OBS-Timestamper** ‚Äî this is a script for [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) that allows you to record timestamps to a file during a live stream. The script was developed for personal use, as one of my methods for learning English is through video games. This tool is extremely helpful for that: I mark timestamps, rewatch the stream, and use those marks to review moments I didn‚Äôt understand ‚Äî such as words or sentence structures. 

Other streamers might use it, for example, to review highlights in CS: like when you got killed even though you were already behind a wall, or to rewatch how you pulled off an ace.
